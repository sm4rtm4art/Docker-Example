# Module 07: Production Excellence

> **Duration**: 3 hours (3 x 1-hour segments)  
> **Level**: Intermediate  
> **Prerequisites**: Modules 1-6 completed

## üéØ Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will:

1. **Create production-grade container images** with minimal attack surface
2. **Implement comprehensive health checks** that actually work
3. **Set resource limits** to prevent container sprawl
4. **Handle signals properly** for graceful shutdowns
5. **Use distroless and scratch images** for ultimate security
6. **Master image optimization** techniques for size and security

## üìö Module Structure

### Part A: Health Checks & Graceful Shutdown (1 hour)

- Why health checks matter (real incident stories)
- HTTP vs TCP vs CMD health checks
- Graceful shutdown patterns
- Signal handling (SIGTERM vs SIGKILL)
- **Exercise**: Break and fix health checks

### Part B: Resource Management (1 hour)

- Memory limits and OOM killer
- CPU limits and throttling
- Storage quotas and log rotation
- File descriptor limits
- **Exercise**: Resource exhaustion debugging

### Part C: Minimal & Secure Images (1 hour)

- Distroless base images
- Building scratch images
- Static binary compilation
- Security scanning with Docker Scout
- **Exercise**: Reduce image size by 90%

## üåü Real-World Problems This Module Solves

### The 3am Wake-Up Call

"Our containers keep getting OOM-killed in production!"

- **Solution**: Proper memory limits and monitoring

### The Security Audit Nightmare

"We failed our security audit due to vulnerable base images"

- **Solution**: Distroless images with minimal attack surface

### The Infinite Restart Loop

"Kubernetes keeps restarting our 'healthy' containers"

- **Solution**: Proper health checks that reflect actual service health

### The Graceless Shutdown

"We're losing in-flight requests during deployments"

- **Solution**: Signal handling and graceful shutdown patterns

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Covered

- Docker health check strategies
- Linux signals and process management
- cgroups for resource limiting
- Distroless base images (Google)
- Multi-stage builds for minimal images
- Security scanning tools

## ‚ö° Quick Preview

```dockerfile
# Production-ready health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1

# Proper signal handling
STOPSIGNAL SIGTERM
ENTRYPOINT ["tini", "--"]
CMD ["node", "server.js"]

# Resource limits in compose

        limits:
          cpus: '0.5'
          memory: 512M
        reservations:
          memory: 256M
```

## üé™ Why This Module Matters

This is where the rubber meets the road. The difference between a "working" container and a **production-ready** container is what separates hobbyists from professionals.

You'll learn why "it works on my machine" isn't good enough and how to build containers that can survive the harsh reality of production environments.
