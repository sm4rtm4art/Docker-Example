# Module 05: Development Workflow - Productive Docker Development 🛠️

Transform your Docker development experience from painful to productive! Master hot reload patterns, debugging techniques, and IDE integrations that make developing in containers feel natural.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By completing this module, you will be able to:

- ✅ Set up efficient development workflows with hot reload
- ✅ Debug applications running inside containers effectively
- ✅ Integrate Docker seamlessly with VS Code, IntelliJ, and other IDEs
- ✅ Separate development and production configurations cleanly
- ✅ Troubleshoot common development environment issues
- ✅ Use bind mounts effectively for rapid iteration

## 📚 Module Structure

### 🔥 Part A: Hot Reload & Live Development (1 hour)

**Focus**: Fast iteration cycles with automatic reloading

- Language-specific hot reload patterns (Java, Python, Rust)
- Bind mount strategies for development
- File watching and automatic rebuilds
- **Troubleshooting**: Permission issues and file sync problems

### 🐛 Part B: Debugging in Containers (1 hour)

**Focus**: Effective debugging techniques for containerized apps

- Remote debugging setup for each language
- Log aggregation and viewing strategies
- Interactive debugging sessions
- Network debugging and port forwarding

### 🎨 Part C: IDE Integration (1 hour)

**Focus**: Seamless editor and IDE integration

- VS Code Remote Containers and Dev Containers
- IntelliJ Docker integration
- Terminal and shell access patterns
- **Best Practices**: Development vs production separation

## 🎯 Real-World Focus

This module solves **actual problems** developers face:

- ❌ "I have to rebuild every time I change a line of code"
- ❌ "I can't debug my app when it's in a container"
- ❌ "My IDE doesn't work with containerized development"
- ❌ "File changes aren't being detected"
- ❌ "I'm losing productivity with this Docker workflow"

## 🚀 What We're Building

### Progressive Development Experience

```
Stage 1: Basic Development
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│    Manual Rebuild Cycle     │
│                             │
│ Code Change → Rebuild →     │
│ Restart → Test             │
│                             │
│ ⏱️  2-3 minutes per cycle    │

Stage 2: Hot Reload
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│   Automatic Development     │
│                             │
│ Code Change → Auto Reload → │
│ Instant Test               │

```

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Completed [Module 03: Dockerfile Essentials](../03-dockerfile-essentials/)
- Completed [Module 04: Docker Compose](../04-docker-compose/)
- Your containerized Task API from previous modules
- IDE installed (VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or similar)
- Basic understanding of your chosen language's development tools

## 🧹 Development Environment Management

**Keep development and production separate!**

- Part A: Development-specific compose files (`docker-compose.dev.yml`)
- Part B: Debug-enabled container configurations
- Part C: IDE-specific ignore patterns and configurations
- Bonus: Automated environment switching scripts

## ✅ Success Criteria

By the end of this module:

- [ ] Achieve sub-3-second code-to-test cycles
- [ ] Successfully debug your application running in a container
- [ ] Use your preferred IDE with containerized development
- [ ] Switch between development and production configurations
- [ ] Troubleshoot file permission and sync issues
- [ ] Feel productive developing with Docker

## 💡 Development Philosophy

**"Make it feel like native development"**

The goal isn't to change how you code—it's to make Docker invisible so you can focus on what matters: building great applications.
