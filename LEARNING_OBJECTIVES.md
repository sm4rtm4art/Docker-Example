# Docker Learning Path - Core Objectives

## üéØ What Students Will Learn (Docker-Focused)

### Beginner Level (Modules 0-3)

‚úÖ **Docker Concepts**

- Understand containers vs virtual machines
- Know when to use Docker
- Understand images, containers, and registries
- Master basic Docker CLI commands

‚úÖ **Container Creation**

- Write effective Dockerfiles
- Build and tag images
- Run and manage containers
- Use volumes for persistence

‚ùå **NOT Teaching**

- Programming language basics
- Framework specifics (Spring, FastAPI, Actix)
- Language-specific build tools details

### Intermediate Level (Modules 4-7)

‚úÖ **Multi-Container Applications**

- Design with Docker Compose
- Implement service communication
- Manage shared volumes
- Handle environment configuration

‚úÖ **Development Workflow**

- Set up efficient local development
- Debug applications in containers
- Implement hot-reload strategies
- Optimize build times

‚úÖ **Production Practices**

- Create minimal, secure images
- Implement health checks
- Manage secrets properly
- Optimize for size and performance

‚ùå **NOT Teaching**

- Microservices architecture
- Database design
- API development
- Language-specific patterns

### Advanced Preview (Modules 8-10)

‚úÖ **CI/CD Integration**

- Automate image builds
- Implement testing in containers
- Push to registries
- Basic vulnerability scanning

‚úÖ **Orchestration Basics**

- Understand when you need orchestration
- Docker Swarm introduction
- Kubernetes concepts preview
- Service discovery basics

‚úÖ **Observability**

- Implement logging strategies
- Basic metrics collection
- Container monitoring
- Troubleshooting techniques

‚ùå **NOT Teaching**

- Advanced Kubernetes
- Service mesh
- Cloud-specific services
- Complex distributed systems

## üìä Skill Assessment Criteria

Students completing this path should be able to:

1. **Containerize Any Application**

   - Given source code, create appropriate Dockerfile
   - Optimize for size and build time
   - Handle different application types

2. **Debug Container Issues**

   - Diagnose startup failures
   - Fix networking problems
   - Resolve permission issues
   - Analyze resource constraints

3. **Design Multi-Container Systems**

   - Create Docker Compose files
   - Implement proper networking
   - Share data between containers
   - Manage dependencies

4. **Prepare for Production**
   - Security hardening
   - Size optimization
   - Implement monitoring
   - Create CI/CD pipelines

## üîç What Makes This Path Different

**Traditional Approach**: "Learn Docker with Node.js/Python/Java"

- Often teaches the language alongside Docker
- Mixes framework concepts with container concepts
- Language-specific focus limits audience

**Our Approach**: "Learn Docker, apply to YOUR language"

- Docker concepts first, language examples second
- Same learning objectives across all tracks
- Clear separation of concerns
- Broader audience reach

## üìà Progression Strategy

```
Module 0-1: Pure Docker (0% language-specific)
     ‚Üì
Module 2-3: Container Basics (30% language-specific for examples only)
     ‚Üì
Module 4-6: Real Applications (20% language-specific for setup)
     ‚Üì
Module 7-8: Production Focus (15% language-specific for optimization)
     ‚Üì
Module 9-10: Platform Skills (10% language-specific for deployment)
```

The language-specific content DECREASES as students advance, because:

- Docker concepts become more universal
- Focus shifts to platform/infrastructure
- Advanced topics are language-agnostic

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

**Good Module Design**:

- "How to implement health checks in Docker"
- "Optimizing layer caching for faster builds"
- "Container networking patterns"

**Poor Module Design**:

- "Building REST APIs with FastAPI in Docker"
- "Spring Boot microservices with Docker"
- "Rust web development in containers"

Remember: We're creating Docker experts who happen to use different languages, not language experts who happen to use Docker.
