# Docker Learning Path - Implementation Tasklist

## 🎯 Mission Statement

Build a comprehensive Docker learning path that takes students from zero to intermediate Docker skills, with multiple language tracks for accessibility. Docker is the hero, languages are the sidekicks.

## 📊 Project Constraints

- **Scope**: Docker fundamentals → Docker Compose → Production practices → K8s preview
- **Time**: Keep each module to 1-2 hours
- **Languages**: Java (existing), Python, Rust priority. C/C++ optional.
- **Principle**: Same Docker concepts across all languages
- **Feasibility**: Reuse 70% content across languages

## ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

- [ ] Create new repository structure: `docker-mastery-multitrack`
- [ ] Extract language-agnostic Docker content from existing Java modules
- [ ] Create Module 00: Prerequisites (language-agnostic)
- [ ] Create Module 01: Docker Fundamentals (language-agnostic)
  - [ ] What are containers vs VMs
  - [ ] Docker architecture
  - [ ] Basic Docker commands
  - [ ] Image and container lifecycle
- [ ] Design common Task API specification (REST endpoints)
- [ ] Create language selector landing page

## ✅ Phase 2: Language Tracks Setup (Weeks 3-4)

- [ ] Create simple "Hello Docker" for each language
  - [ ] Java: Spring Boot (existing, just refactor)
  - [ ] Python: FastAPI + UV
  - [ ] Rust: Actix-web
- [ ] Module 02: Your First Container (language-specific)
  - [ ] Same learning objectives, different code
  - [ ] Focus on Dockerfile basics, not language specifics
- [ ] Module 03: Building Images (language-specific)
  - [ ] Multi-stage builds
  - [ ] Layer caching
  - [ ] Size optimization

## ✅ Phase 3: Docker Skills Development (Weeks 5-6)

- [ ] Module 04: Docker Compose (mostly language-agnostic)
  - [ ] Multi-container applications
  - [ ] Networking (bridge, host, none)
  - [ ] Volumes vs Bind Mounts
  - [ ] Named volumes and volume lifecycle
  - [ ] Environment management
  - [ ] Orphan containers and cleanup strategies
- [ ] Module 05: Development Workflow
  - [ ] Hot reload setups
  - [ ] Debugging in containers
  - [ ] IDE integrations
- [ ] Module 06: Docker Security & Best Practices
  - [ ] Non-root users (mandatory default)
  - [ ] When root IS needed (package installation, ports <1024)
  - [ ] User namespace remapping
  - [ ] Secrets management (never in ENV)
  - [ ] Read-only containers
  - [ ] Security scanning basics
  - [ ] Health checks
  - [ ] Resource limits

## ✅ Phase 4: Production & Advanced Topics (Weeks 7-8)

- [ ] Module 07: Production Readiness
  - [ ] Multi-stage builds deep dive
  - [ ] Distroless and minimal images
  - [ ] Security scanning
- [ ] Module 08: CI/CD with Docker
  - [ ] GitHub Actions
  - [ ] GitLab CI
  - [ ] Building and pushing images
- [ ] Module 09: Container Orchestration Intro
  - [ ] Docker Swarm basics
  - [ ] Kubernetes preview
  - [ ] When to use what
- [ ] Module 10: Observability
  - [ ] Logging strategies
  - [ ] Metrics with Prometheus
  - [ ] Distributed tracing basics
- [ ] Module 11: Beyond Docker
  - [ ] Podman introduction (daemonless containers)
  - [ ] Docker vs Podman comparison
  - [ ] Migrating from Docker to Podman
  - [ ] Other alternatives (containerd, CRI-O)
  - [ ] When to use what

## 📋 Content Development Guidelines

### For Each Module:

- [ ] Learning objectives (Docker-focused)
- [ ] Hands-on exercises (2-3 per module)
- [ ] Common troubleshooting section
- [ ] "Going Further" section for advanced students
- [ ] Assessment questions (5 per module)

### Language-Specific Sections Must:

- [ ] Take ≤30% of module content
- [ ] Focus on Docker integration, not language features
- [ ] Use idiomatic patterns but don't teach them
- [ ] Assume basic language knowledge

### Shared Resources:

- [ ] Docker command cheat sheet
- [ ] Dockerfile best practices guide
- [ ] Security checklist
- [ ] Performance optimization guide
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide

## 🚫 Out of Scope (Keep Focus!)

- ❌ Teaching programming languages
- ❌ Framework deep-dives (Spring, FastAPI, Actix details)
- ❌ Advanced Kubernetes (just preview)
- ❌ Cloud-specific implementations (ECS, GKE, etc.)
- ❌ Service mesh, advanced orchestration
- ❌ Language-specific build tools beyond Docker needs

## 📈 Success Metrics

- [ ] Student can containerize any application in their language
- [ ] Student understands Docker networking and storage
- [ ] Student can debug container issues
- [ ] Student can optimize images for production
- [ ] Student knows when to use orchestration
- [ ] Completion time: 15-20 hours total

## 🔄 Review Checkpoints

1. After Phase 1: Is Docker content truly language-agnostic?
2. After Phase 2: Are language examples minimal but effective?
3. After Phase 3: Can students work with Docker professionally?
4. After Phase 4: Are students ready for real-world scenarios?

## 💡 Key Decisions Made

1. UV for Python - modern, fast, shows Rust connection
2. Focus on containers, not languages
3. Same API across all languages for consistency
4. Progressive difficulty within Docker, not language complexity
5. Production-ready practices from the start

## 🎯 Next Immediate Actions

1. [ ] Create new repository with proposed structure
2. [ ] Write Module 01: Docker Fundamentals (pure Docker)
3. [ ] Create Task API specification
4. [ ] Build one working example in each language
5. [ ] Test the learning flow with one complete module

**Remember**: We're teaching Docker. The languages are just different doors into the same house.
